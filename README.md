           **** Important Information ****

For templates, when a POST is initiated to harvest
credentials, you will need a site for it to redirect.

You can configure this option under:

      /etc/setoolkit/set.config

Edit this file, and change HARVESTER_REDIRECT and
HARVESTER_URL to the sites you want to redirect to
after it is posted. If you do not set these, then
it will not redirect properly. This only goes for
templates.
