* IMPORTANT * READ THIS BEFORE ENTERING IN THE IP ADDRESS * IMPORTANT * ---

The way that this works is by cloning a site and looking for form fields to
rewrite. If the POST fields are not usual methods for posting forms this 
could fail. If it does, you can always save the HTML, rewrite the forms to
be standard forms and use the "IMPORT" feature. Additionally, really 
important:

If you are using an EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS, you need to place the EXTERNAL
IP address below, not your NAT address. Additionally, if you don't know
basic networking concepts, and you have a private IP address, you will
need to do port forwarding to your NAT IP address from your external IP
address. A browser doesns't know how to communicate with a private IP
address, so if you don't specify an external IP address if you are using
this from an external perpective, it will not work. This isn't a SET issue
this is how networking works
